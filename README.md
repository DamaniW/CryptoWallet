# CryptoWallet

### Background

In this assignment, I will be building a new and disruptive platform called Fintech Finder. Fintech Finder is an application that its customers can use to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them. I have been tasked with integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable your customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency. 

The steps for this challenge are broken out into the following sections:

1. Import Ethereum Transaction Functions into the Fintech Finder Application
2. Sign and Execute a Payment Transaction
3. Inspect the Transaction on Ganache

### Inspection

After we execute a transaction on the Streamlit app, we can view the results from our Ganache software.
